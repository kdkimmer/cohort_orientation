Web Development and Design: This project is focused on getting your personal website up and running and to create the LaunchCoderGirl Website! Other options include building an Adventure Game or a Javascript game.

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (Javascript is a bonus!) A great way to do this is to get through Lesson 12 at (freeCodeCamp.com). For more info check out the presentation and Helena's blog to get started! (https://girlbitsnbytes.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/get-thee-a-website/)
