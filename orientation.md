The orientations will cover version control, project planning, and how to 
effectively work on a team. The format will be a day long conference with 
workshops. There will be TWO dates offered, however, you only need to 
attend ONE. They will have the exact same content, but are offered on 
two different weekend days for your convenience.

9:30-12:00: Team Process Workshop

12:00-1:00: Lunch

1:00-4:00: Team Technicals and Hands-On Practice

Google Hangout lets you talk while you screen share.  With newer laptops, the built-in microphone
works fine.  Older laptops don't have a microphone, so you may need a headset to pick up your voice.
If you do need a headset, the [Microsoft 
Lifechat LX-3000](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-JUG-00001-LifeChat-LX-3000-Headset/dp/B000J4WPW8) 
works well.

We'll be shifting from BlueJ to Eclipse because it cooperates better for team projects.
