variety of applications or games. Some of the options include 
building a web crawler/scraper, recipe software, or simple video game.

Prerequisites: Understanding of variables for text, data, and 
arithmetic; if statement comparisons and logic, methods with and 
without return values; loops; and the ability to code and plan 
simple programs. You'll need to be able to devote 4 hours outside
