CS50 focused project: This project is designed to incorporate the 
interests of the group to work on a project you would be truly invested in 
completing. Expect to work on a team of about 4-6 people and have 
4-8 hours available outside of the CoderGirl meetup to work on the project.

Prerequisites: In order for this project to be the best use of your 
time, you’ll need to have completed up to Problem Set 3 in CS50 
and watched all Lectures through Week 6.
